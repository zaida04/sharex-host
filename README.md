# sharex-image-host

Made this because I needed to host my own images for ShareX. It's a simple image host that uses [bun](https://bun.sh) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

To get set up:

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

To run (using Bun):

```bash
bun run start
```

To run (using PM2):

```bash
pm2 start
```
